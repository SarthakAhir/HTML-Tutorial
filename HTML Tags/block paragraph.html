     <p class="planet-detail">Mercury is the first planet from the Sun and the smallest planet in the Solar System.
         It is a terrestrial planet with a heavily cratered surface due to the planet having no 
         geological activity and an extremely tenuous atmosphere.Mercury is a naturally-occurring 
         chemical element found in rock in the earth's crust, including in deposits of coal. On the 
         periodic table, it has the symbol "Hg" and its atomic number is 80. It exists in several forms:
          Elemental (metallic) mercury.Inorganic mercury compounds.</p>

          <p class="planet-detail">Venus is the second planet from the Sun. It is a rocky planet with the densest atmosphere of 
            all the rocky bodies in the Solar System, and the only one with a mass and size that is close to
             that of its orbital neighbour Earth.From Earth, Venus is the brightest object in the night sky 
             after our own Moon. The ancients, therefore, gave it great importance in their cultures, even
              thinking it was two objects: a morning star and an evening star.</p>

                and found habitability. This is enabled by Earth being a water world, the only one in the Solar
                 System sustaining liquid surface water.Earth is about eight light-minutes away from the Sun and orbits it, taking a year (about 365.25 days) to complete one revolution. Earth rotates around its own ...

                    The reddish color of its surface is due to finely grained iron(III) oxide dust in 
                    the soil, giving it the nickname "the Red Planet". Mars's radius is second smallest
                     among the planets in the Solar System at 3,389.5 km</P>
